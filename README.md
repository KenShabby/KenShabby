# Brendan Coen

I've been taking a mile wide, inch deep approach to getting back into tech. Realized I didn't know how CIDR notation worked, so I figured it out and in the process of going down the rabbit hole, earned myself the CompTIA Network+ (Dec. '24) and Security+ (Jan. '25) certs. 

Otherise, I'm spending my time working on tuning my Python and C++ skills until some other avenue grabs my attention.

After 20 years in real estate, I figure now's the time to make a change. I'm not above working help desk if that gets my foot in the door.
